# Emotion Classification in Images: Happy vs. Sad

This project is a simple yet effective introduction to the world of neural networks and deep learning. It focuses on classifying emotions in images as either "Happy" or "Sad" using a neural network model. The goal is to accurately (or nearly accurately) predict the emotion in the given images.

## Project Overview

This project involves training a neural network to classify images into one of two categories:
- **Class 1:** Sad
- **Class 2:** Happy

The project serves as an entry point into the field of neural networks, providing hands-on experience with image classification tasks. By the end of this project, I aim to have a model that can accurately predict (or come very close to accurately predicting) the emotion depicted in an image.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images labeled as either "Happy" or "Sad." The images are stored in Google Drive and are used to train and evaluate the model.

### Accessing the Dataset

The dataset can be accessed via the following Google Drive link:
[Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zWFnDQt2xOoRCO4GqhhCw3B6s8pHFKq1?usp=drive_link)

Make sure to mount your Google Drive in the Colab notebook to access the images.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

# Adjust the path as required to match your own Google Drive structure
```python
data_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Image Classifier/data'
```

## Model

The neural network model used in this project is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is designed to learn from the features in the images and classify them into one of the two classes.

### Model Architecture

- **Input Layer:** Accepts images of a specific size.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracts features from the images.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Uses extracted features to make a decision.
- **Output Layer:** Outputs a probability for each class (Sad or Happy).

### Training

The model is trained using the labeled dataset. Various techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and early stopping are employed to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

## Results

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance. The goal is to accurately predict the class of each image:

- **Class 1:** Sad
- **Class 2:** Happy

If the model predicts the correct class or is very close to doing so, the objective is considered achieved!

## How to Use

### Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

These can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```
### Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:**

   - Access the notebook directly on Google Colab using [this link](#).

2. **Mount Google Drive:**

   Ensure your Google Drive is mounted so the dataset can be accessed.

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

### Run the Cells

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

### Model Prediction

The model will output predictions for the test images, indicating whether they are "Happy" or "Sad."

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

```bash
├── model.ipynb               # The main notebook for the project
├── README.md                 # This README file
└── data/                     # Directory containing the image dataset (in Google Drive)
└── logs/                     # Directory containing training logs and model checkpoints
```

## Conclusion

This project represents my first steps into the fascinating world of neural networks. By training a model to classify images as "Happy" or "Sad," I have begun to understand the intricacies of deep learning and image classification. While this is a simple project, it lays the foundation for more complex work in the future.

If the model predicts (or almost predicts) the emotions in the images accurately, I consider my job well done!

## Future Work

In future iterations of this project, I plan to:

- Experiment with more complex models, such as deeper CNN architectures.
- Explore different datasets to improve the robustness of the model.
- Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.
